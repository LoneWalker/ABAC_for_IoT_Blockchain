# A Permissioned Blockchain based Access Control System for IOT

This is the implementation of our paper titled "A Permissioned Blockchain based Access Control System for IOT". Here we have implemented attribute-based access control (ABAC) for IOT in smartcontract. The smartcontract is written in go and runs on Hyperledge Fabric. It can take any ABAC request and evaluate it against ABAC policy. The blockchain acts as a distributed policy decision making point for IOT resource.


#Technology
1) Runs on Hyperledger Fabric- a popular permissioned blockchain
2) Chaincode (smartcontract) implementation language: google go
